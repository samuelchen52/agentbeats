<h1 class = center> Agent Beats </h1>
<h2 class = center> Game Design Document </h2>
<h2 class = center> by David Chen, Chris Liang, Samuel Chen </h2>




<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>
<p>
This document describes a game called "Agent Beats", which is designed to be a 2D top-down rhythm puzzler. The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, efficient memory management, and more basic 2D game techniques.
</p>


<h3>TECHNOLOGY </h3>
<p>
Agent Beats will be developed for the Windows Platform using the Phaser game engine, which is a free, open-source HTML5 game framework. OpenGL will be used as the underlying rendering technology. Phaser will also be used for all music and sound effects management. All music and artwork will be created in-house with Adobe Creative Suite and GarageBand. Other technologies may be added as development continues.
</p>



<h3>BACK STORY</h3>
<p>
In an alternate universe, the world is powered by music. The better the song, the more energy it produces. S.W.A.M.P(Sinister Wrongdoers Against Music Preservation) has released a deadly virus into the worldwide database of music, slowly deleting the best songs. W.A.S.P.(World Audio Security Patrol) has sent agent after agent into the mysterious SWAMP, only to have them disappear one by one. Left with no choice, Agent Beats, the best of the best among his peers, is assigned to the case. Thus, his journey begins as he ventures deeper into SWAMP headquarters to uncover its secrets.
</p>

<h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
<p>
SWAMP doesnâ€™t like intruders and, as such, has rigged its headquarters with a wide assortment of booby traps. Agent Beats must successfully navigate through these traps, with each level becoming progressively harder. He must make it to the top floor of SWAMP, where the virus is being transmitted from, and destroy it to save the world. 
</p>

<h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
<p>
The game will be a top-down tile-based game. Beats will be able to move in 4 directions, up,down,left,right. He will move one tile per button press.
Each tile in the level is potentially dangerous, what with the various traps set. However, the traps have a specific pattern, as they match the beat of the background music, so Beats must move along with the cadence of the music. The tiles may also change to the beat of the background music, so it is possible for a tile to disappear right underneath Beats. The traps and tiles follow a specific pattern, so it is up to Beats to cleverly observe and follow the pattern to successfully navigate through each level.
</p>



<h3>CONTROLS</h3>
<p>
This game will be played with just the arrow keys. Once started, use the following:
<ul>
<li>LEFT-ARROW - Move Left  </li>
<li>RIGHT-ARROW - Move Right  </li>
<li>UP-ARROW - Move Up </li>
<li>DOWN-ARROW - Move Down </li>
<li>ESC - This pauses the game and presents a pop-up window to the player asking them to continue when they are ready. If a game is not in progress, ESC does nothing. </li>
</ul>
<p>



<h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</h3>
<p>
As far as the GUI is concerned, if we consider
Splash Screen - The splash screen GUI simply presents a game logo and a Start button for the user to press when they are ready to play. Upon pressing it, a brief scripted sequence is played explaining a little about Agent Beats and the back story for the game. While playing the message "Press ESC to Skip" should be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If pressed, the game should immediately start.
In-Game Menu - While the game is in progress, we'll always have a game menu that allows the player to select from the following options:
Exit Level - will prompt user if they really want to exit level. Upon pressing yes, will exit and go back to the level select screen
Pause Game - This button is deactivated when a game is not in progress. If pressed, it will produce the same effect as the ESC key.
Controls - If pressed, the game will display an info screen that includes a description of all game controls.
Best Times - If pressed, the game will display an info screen with the fastest times for clearing the level.
About - If pressed, the game will display an info screen with information about the game author.
Exit - If pressed, the game program will exit.
In-Game GUI - Once a game starts, a 5-4-3-2-1-Begin sequence is counted down and displayed for the player to see. At Begin, the changing room door opens and Spike pops out in his Red protective suit. Balloons will begin to be deployed about the chamber. While playing the following will be displayed at all times:
Time Remaining
Popped Red Balloons/Red Balloons Remaining
Popped Green Balloons/Green Balloons Remaining
Popped Blue Balloons/Blue Balloons Remaining
In addition, three buttons will be be part of the in-game GUI, meaning overlayed on top of the game world. These are buttons for selecting Red, Green, and Blue suits. These buttons will only be selectable when Spike is standing in front of the changing room door. If Spike is in front of the door and the player clicks on a suit colored differently than the one Spike is currently wearing, then the door will slide open, Spike will disappear inside momentarily, the door will then slide closed, and then will slide open again, with Spike popping out in his new suit.
</p>


<h3>ARTWORK</h3>
<p>

All artwork in the game will be original. The following needs to be created:
<br>
<br>
Agent Beats - will only have one outfit. Will require animations for:
<ul>
<li> Moving Right  </li>
<li> Moving Left </li>
<li> Moving Up </li>
<li> Moving Down </li>
<li> Dying </li>
<li> Idle State </li>
</ul>
<br>
Booby Traps - there will be various booby traps e.g. spikes, lasers, etc. that will require animations for when they go off. Each one will have these basics animations:
<ul>
<li> Activate </li>
<li> Collide with Player </li>
<li> Idle </li>
</ul>
<br>
-Background and Floor Tiles - The background will just be for decoration, but we will have a dynamic changing background to add to the feel of each level. Basic tiles will be used for floor. The tiles will have an outline to clearly define where each tile is. The tile may change color/texture according to the music.
Next Level Portal - Each level will have a Portal marking the goal tile. Stepping on this portal will complete the current level and advance Beats to the next level. 

<br>
<br>
-Splash Screen - The Splash Screen will just be static artwork of Beats and his world. It will display on game load and on the main menu.
</p>


<h3>SOUND EFFECTS</h3>
<p>
All sound effects will be original. Sounds must be made to coincide with each of the following events:
Moving
Traps going off
Agent dying
Agent clearing a level 
</p>


<h3>MUSIC</h3>
<p>
Since each level must match the cadence of the background music, the music will be a very important part of the game. Each level will have a unique song that all the traps and tile movements will coincide with. Music will be originally made using GarageBand and Audacity.
